This is a simple program that asks the user to enter their age.
The program will then calculate how many months, days, and hours
old the user is.  If a negative number of years is entered, the
the program will not crash, but will produce bogus results.
The program does not account for leap years and assumes the user's
age is exactly the number of years entered.
